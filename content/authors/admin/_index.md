Development of smart grids and the increasing penetration of Information and Communication Technology has taken place in recent years for better monitoring and control of the power system. The application of big data techniques in power system can lead to real time optimization of generation and transmission, accurate prediction of load demand and dynamic pricing strategies. However, current status of both power systems and big data technologies still need to overcome different challenges. My goal is to contribute towards better integration of these technologies in order to have smarter and better future grids.
